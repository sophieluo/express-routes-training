Did the number guessing game and the first part of art gallery, but didn't get the last part of art gallery to work. Looked at solution but couldn't figure out how the variables refer to the ones in the gallery route if not specified. Need to ask about this tomorrow. Other than this, I think I know what I'm doing.

DIDN'T FIGURE THIS PART OUT:

4. Create a new HTML view called `art-gallery.html`. Add a route at `/art-gallery` to display this view. Add a form to this view that collects the information you need to add a new artwork.

<!-- 5. Create a new client-side JavaScript file called `gallery.js`, link it to your `art-gallery.html`, and write an AJAX call to submit the new artwork form to the correct route with its data.  If the request is successful, log the response to the console in the browser. -->

<!-- 1. Update the client-side JavaScript so that once an artwork is added successfully on the server, the artwork information is displayed on the page. -->

<!-- 1. Write a route that allows you to change an artwork in the list of artworks. The route should take in the old title and all new information for the artwork. **Hint**: Use the HTML methods `PATCH` or `PUT`. -->
